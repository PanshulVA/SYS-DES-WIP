## Reasons to use NOSQL DB  
1) When all other components of system are fast querying and searching for data becomes a bottleneck  
----->NOSQL prevent data from being bottleneck  
  

**BIG DATA IS A LARGE SUCCESS FOR NOSQL**  
  

2) To store large volumes of data with little to no structure  
There's no limit on type of data  
Document DB as an example stores all data in one place with no need of type of data to be specified  
  
  
  
3) Using Cloud and Storage to the fullest makes it an excellent cost saving solution.
There's an easy spread of data across multiple servers to scale up
